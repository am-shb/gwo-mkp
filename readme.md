# binary grey wolf optimizer for the multidimensional knapsack problem

Binary grey wolf optimizer used to solve the multidimensinal kanpsack problem. GK benchmark problems are employed to test the results.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Choose the benchmark problem to be solved from main.py
3. run `python main.py` in a console

### Requirements
```
numpy
scipy
numba
```
numba is used to increase execution speed using JIT.
